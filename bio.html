<p>Pascal Hien is a designer from Germany. After studio experiences at Arik Levy in Paris and a residency at Fabrica research center in Italy, he is currently working for Steelcase Inc. He collaborates as a creative consultant with brands amongst product, interior and fashion design. <br>
<br>
His recent activity has led him towards user orientated and systemic industrial design while keeping close connection to artisanal crafts and limited editions. Driven by a curious and optimistic design method, his work wanders between function, elegance and irritation.</p>
