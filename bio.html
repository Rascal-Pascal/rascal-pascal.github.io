<p>Pascal Hien is a designer from Germany. After studio and residency experiences in France and Italy, he is currently working for Steelcase Inc. He collaborates as a creative consultant with brands amongst product, interior and fashion design. <br>
<br>
His recent activity has led him towards user oriented industrial design while pursuing to work with artisans in limited editions. He believes that the diversity between craft and modern manufacturing can coexist within contemporary design. <br>
<br>
For Pascal, design is only meaningful when it impacts and improves people’s daily routines. His commitment is to think and create less with a circular, honest and socially responsible approach. He looks at creation in a holistic way, not divided into its single disciplines. Driven by a curious and optimistic design method, his work wanders between function, confrontation and elegance. <br>
