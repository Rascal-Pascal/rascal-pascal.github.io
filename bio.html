<p>After graduating from UDK Berlin in 2014, german designer Pascal Hien was awarded a scholarship at Fabrica Research Center in Italy, followed by professional experiences at Steelcase Inc. and working as senior assistant to Konstantin Grcic. By gaining valuable knowledge and learning from within the practice, Pascal decided to open his own office for design in 2022.<br>
<br>
Pascal Hien Design is a holistic creative agency offering long term experience within the field of industrial, exhibition and conceptual design. Today’s projects are not only created on the drawing board, but require a deep understanding of technology, future economy and human behavior. 
<br>
<br>
The studio offers a complete service from initial research, creative consultancy and ideation to final launch. Within the process we analyze what could be reduced, reused or reworked. We connect a unique network of creatives to make meaningful design that impacts and improves our daily routines.
